# VaultMapsMenu

I know there was a great amount of interest in the VaultMaps Panorama UI, so I decided to post it here publicly for all to see and use for future reference. However, please don't copy and paste it directly for use in any of your own projectsâ€”it is just for reference for usage on the Panorama system and how to properly use it. Enjoy!
